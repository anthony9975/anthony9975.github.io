        <h1>Hi, I'm Anthony</h1>
        <p>
            I'm a second year Computer Engineering major at UCSB and I will be graduating in June 2028. I have a robust 
            programming background, with knowledge in R, SQL, Java, and C++. I am interested in computer architecture,
            deep learning, and VLSI. I am currently learning HTML to build up this webpage, and in the future I plan to 
            learn Rust and Verilog.
